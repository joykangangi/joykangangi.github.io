### About Me
I am Joy Kangangi, currently a third year undergraduate student studying Mathematics and Computer Science in Nairobi, Kenya.
I enjoy problem solving using Mathematics and programming.
My aim is developing mobile applications that would impact the society positively.

### My Journey
My interest in software engineering and coding, in general, began after high school. I enrolled for a computer packages short course in 2019 February. While pursuing the course I was fascinated by how computers worked, which made my interest grow. I decided that my degree, that I was about to choose shortly, would involve computer technology. Later on our tutor in the course mentioned about tech-related degrees and I discovered Mathematics and Computer Science. In 2020 January, I joined my university's Google Developer Students Club which I am still part of up to date. I meet tech-enthusiasts whom I admired and got exposed to various fields in tech. In April 2020, I started learning Android-development with Kotlin. I enjoyed it all and I have been creating mobile applications since then. The encouragement from fellow android developers, family and friends motivated me so much, and that's how I got into mobile.

### My Technical Skills
I am well versed, but not limited, in the following: Kotlin, Java, MatLab, C++, Cisco Networking
